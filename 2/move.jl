"""
    swap(pathway, move, distance, weights) -> (Vector{Int}, Float64)
  Swaps two elements in the `pathway` and calculates its length.

## Parameters:
- `pathway::Vector{Int}`: path with a given order of visited nodes.
- `move::Tuple{Int, Int}`: move to make, array of path's indexes `i` and `j`.
- `distance::Float64`: original path's distance.
- `weights::AbstractMatrix{Float64}`: matrix of weights between nodes.
  
## Returns:
- `Vector{Int}`: changed path.
- `Float64`: lenght of the changed path.
